# Calculator

Calculator is a simple calculator that performs floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication and addition. Everything was coded from scratch using vanilla JS. The biggest challenge was parsing input from strings to numbers that can be calculated upon while thinking about order of operations in more complicated expressions such as: `3 + 2 * 7 - 5`

## Features
These are some of the features of the simple calculator:
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with integer and floating point numbers
* Keyboard input
* Order of Operations
* Cannot Divide by 0
